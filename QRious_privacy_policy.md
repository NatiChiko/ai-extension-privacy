# Privacy Policy – QRious

QRious does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your privacy is important, and this extension is designed to respect it by default.

## 🔒 What We Don't Do:
- We **do not collect or store** any URLs, QR codes, or user activity.
- We **do not track usage** or analytics.
- We **do not transmit** any data to external servers.
- We **do not require** a login, signup, or user account.

## ⚙️ Permissions Used:
QRious only requests the minimal permissions required to function:

- `activeTab`: to access the current tab’s URL for QR code generation.
- `downloads`: to allow users to save QR codes directly to their device.

All QR code generation and file downloads are handled **locally in your browser**.

## 📴 Offline by Design
QRious works fully offline. It does not rely on an internet connection and does not communicate with any third-party services.
